# Notes

This is a notetaking program built on [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick),
inspired by [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

I wanted a note taking program that has the same basic functionality as
tiddlywiki (associative, non-linear notetaking with links as the main
construct), but as I prefer the command line, I tried to implement something
that works without using the mouse.

## Running

E.g.
```
stack install
~/.local/bin/notes-exe
```

## WIP

This is a work in process. There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of

- Data model
- Serialization
- Rendering

If anyone is interested in helping out, please let me know.
