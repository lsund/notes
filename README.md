# Notes WIP

This is a notetaking program built on [brick][https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick],
inspired by [Tiddlywiki][https://tiddlywiki.com/].

I wanted a note taking program that has the same basic functionality as
tiddlywiki (associative, non-linear notetaking with links as the main
construct), but as I prefer the command line, I tried to implement something
that works without using the mouse.
